      <h3>Explain your capstone</h3>
      <p className="explain-capstone">
        My main focus has been on project structure, foundation, routing, as
        well as logic and understanding. I thought it would be a good idea to
        combine the components that we have been working on throughout the
        course into one project. I want to make sure that am understanding the
        concepts and the fundamentals of each component and how they work
        together to make sure that I am able to properly implement functional
        and aesthetically pleasing React Apps.

      <h3>Explain what you learned throughout your time here</h3>
      <p className="explain-learned">
        <p>
          "I have learned a lot and I am still learning. I have a deep and
          profound appreciation for the knowledge that I have acquired and for
          the outlet that has been provided for me to learn and grow. I have a
          desire to be skilled in this field of knowledge and I am doing my best
          to restructure my mind to embrace the possibilities."

      <h3>Explain your favorite language and why</h3>
      <p className="explain-favorite">
        <p>
          "Inconclusive due to insufficient data. I've only just begun with a
          mere handful of languages and deciding on a favorite would be jumping
          to conclusions. Right now I am doing my best to identify the structure
          and the components that are congruent within each language and
          becoming more familiar with the syntax and the logic while developing
          a better understanding of the foundation of each language. I would
          like to say that I can't help but have an attraction to this form of
          knowledge. I am enjoying my time and I am looking forward to learning
          more. I am doing my best to absorb as much as I can at as accelerated
          a rate as able. Although I am aware of the time constraints of the
          course, I am in no rush because my competition is with my former Self
          and my goal is to develop a better understanding of the fundamentals
          and to become a better programmer."
